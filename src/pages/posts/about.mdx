# Hello, World!

I'm Ash!<sub>*(she/they)*</sub> A very *‚ú®üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è queer üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è‚ú®* 2nd year Comp-Sci student (currently on placement) 
who loves rust, linux, mechanical keyboards and blue ikea sharks *:3*. 
I'm currently learning rust and c# and tinkering with astro to create simple websites.

I like working on all projects, big and small. 
From stuff that runs on small microcontrollers to large scale web applications in the cloud.
I always love a challenge and learning about new languages, frameworks, tools and workflows.
