## About

I like working on all projects, big and small. 
From stuff that runs on small microcontrollers to large scale web applications in the cloud.
I always love a challenge and learning about new languages, frameworks, tools and workflows.
I'm currently learning rust and c# and tinkering with astro to create simple websites.
