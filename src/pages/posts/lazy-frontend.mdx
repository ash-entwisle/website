    Over the past couple of years, I've been using Astro to build websites, both static and dynamic.

## Disclaimer

Right off the bat, im going to ask you to take not just a grain of salt, but an entire tablespoon. 
I very much dislike frontend development and I'm not very good at it (just look at this website lol). 
This is purely my opinion as a backend developer / sysadmin who keeps drawing the short straw in my uni group projects. 

## What is Astro?
