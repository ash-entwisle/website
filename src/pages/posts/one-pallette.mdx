## Context

OneDark is a theme originally developed for the Atom text editor.
Its a nice dark theme with pastel accents and a nice contrast thats not too harsh.
You can find the original theme [here](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax)

##  Intro

If any of you know me IRL or have seen my desktop or any other project ive had any creative control over,
you'll notice that they all look relatively simmilar. 
This is because I use the same color pallette for everything.

I have used it everywhere from custom minecraft texture packs
to my desktop wallpaper, from my terminal to this very website. 
I have written the theme out enough times that I can remember most of the colors off by heart. 

The real question is though... 

## Why?

why not, its an underated theme. 
the colours are easy on the eyes without being too bright or too dark. 
Plus atom holds a special place in my heart, it was my first text editor.
the Atom editor is what truly kicked off my love for programming and tech in general.
Having an editor that you could just mess around with and make your own was great 
and the only resaon why I switched to vscode was because it was no longer being maintained 
and its forks diddnt feel as good as the original. 

That doesnt mean im sticking to code, the right tool just doesnt exist yet. 
Current contenders in the running for me are Zed and Helix
(bonus points to zed for being built by the old atom team), 
the only thing holding these back is the customisability. 
once they have a good plugin ecosystem, I may switch.
