## Introduction

For the past 6 months, I have been playing around with my homelab. 
Nothing special, just a small minipc running a few services that i use supprisingly often. 

## Hardware

After getting a notification that Minisforum had a sale, I decided to pick up one of their minipc's. 
Its a small form factor pc with a Ryzen 7 7940HX(?) with a spare drive from my old pc and 32gb of ram.
It is a bit overkill for what I use it for, but it gives me room to mess around with stuff. 

### Performance

As i mentioned, its pretty overkill for what I use it for. 
While running all of my current services *and* streaming a 4k movie from jellyfin,
ive not gotten it to use more then 4GB of ram.
Needless to say, I have a fair bit of headroom to play with.

## Software

### OS

For the OS, I decided to go with OpenSuse Tumbleweed. 
Ive been playing around with it on an old laptop and have found it to be supprisingly stable for a rolling release distro. 

### Services

I only have a few services currently running. 
I do however plan on increasing this list in the future, just depends what catches my eye.
So far, I have:

- Jellyfin
- NFS
- [OpenBot](https://github.com/ash-entwisle/OpenBot)

In future, I plan on setting up gitea as a local mirror of my github 
as well as a few game servers such as minecraft and factorio.
and anything else that looks interesting.

### Other stuff

I also have the lab set up as a single node kubernetes cluster as a way to learn more about k8s.
I also use it as a mock-production environment to test out stuff for some personal projects 
*(hopefully something cool coming soon^tm)*
